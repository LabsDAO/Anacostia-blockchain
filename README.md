##Anacostia-Blockchain
Welcome to Anacostia-Blockchain, an advanced extension of the Anacostia framework designed to revolutionize Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) by harnessing the power of blockchain technology. Anacostia-Blockchain aims to simplify, secure, and enhance the efficiency of the MLOps process, making it more transparent and accessible.

##Anacostia-Blockchain Concepts & Terminology
Anacostia-Blockchain builds upon the core Anacostia framework by integrating blockchain technology, offering several key advantages:

Decentralized Data Storage: Utilizes networks like IPFS for secure, immutable storage of ML models and datasets.
Smart Contract Automation: Employs smart contracts to automate compliance, versioning, and model deployment processes.
Tokenization of ML Models: Facilitates the creation of NFTs for ML models, enabling a novel marketplace for models.
Core Node Types
Metadata Store Nodes: Now capable of recording metadata on the blockchain for immutable history and enhanced trust.
Resource Nodes: Support for decentralized storage, ensuring secure and globally accessible data sharing.
Action Nodes: Extended to include blockchain interactions such as minting model NFTs and executing smart contracts for deployment.
Distinguishing Features
Local and Cloud Compatibility: Works seamlessly both locally and in cloud environments, benefiting from blockchain's security and transparency.
Incremental Pipeline Building: Allows for stepwise pipeline construction, with blockchain integration enhancing each stage.
Interchangeable Nodes: Provides a standardized API for nodes, facilitating easy substitution and blockchain service integration.
Installation
Make sure you're running Python 3.11 or later. See CONTRIBUTORS.md for guidance on updating Python.

bash
Copy code
pip install anacostia-blockchain
Example Usage
Below is an example demonstrating how to set up a simple MLOps pipeline with Anacostia-Blockchain, including steps for model evaluation and leveraging blockchain for enhanced data integrity and model management.

python
Copy code
# Import pipeline and node classes
from anacostia_blockchain.pipeline import Pipeline
from anacostia_blockchain.nodes import MonitoringDataStoreNode, ShakespeareEvalNode
from anacostia_blockchain.metadata import SqliteMetadataStore
# Assume blockchain-related variables and imports are initialized here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize metadata store and nodes
    metadata_store = SqliteMetadataStore("metadata_store", "sqlite:///metadata.db")
    data_store = MonitoringDataStoreNode("data_store", "/data/path", metadata_store)
    eval_node = ShakespeareEvalNode("eval_node", [data_store], metadata_store)
    
    # Define and execute the pipeline, integrating blockchain functionalities
    pipeline = Pipeline(nodes=[metadata_store, data_store, eval_node])
    pipeline.execute()
