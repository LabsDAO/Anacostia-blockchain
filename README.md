## Anacostia-Blockchain

Welcome to Anacostia-Blockchain, an advanced extension of the Anacostia framework designed to revolutionize Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) by harnessing the power of blockchain technology. Anacostia-Blockchain aims to simplify, secure, and enhance the efficiency of the MLOps process, making it more transparent and accessible.

## Anacostia-Blockchain Concepts & Terminology

Anacostia-Blockchain builds upon the core Anacostia framework by integrating blockchain technology, offering several key advantages:

- **Decentralized Data Storage**: Utilizes networks like IPFS for secure, immutable storage of ML models and datasets.
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Employs smart contracts to automate compliance, versioning, and model deployment processes.
- **Tokenization of ML Models**: Facilitates the creation of NFTs for ML models, enabling a novel marketplace for models.

## Core Components

Anacostia-Blockchain integrates several key technologies to enhance the capabilities of MLOps pipelines. Below is an overview of the core components and how they contribute to the ecosystem:

### IPFS

- **Functionality**: The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is used for decentralized data storage. It enables secure, immutable storage of machine learning models and datasets, ensuring data persistence and accessibility without relying on centralized servers.
- **Benefits**: By leveraging IPFS, Anacostia-Blockchain ensures that ML assets are tamper-proof and globally accessible, facilitating collaboration and model sharing across different organizations and geographies.

### Story Protocol

- **Functionality**: Story Protocol is utilized for intellectual property (IP) licensing within the Anacostia-Blockchain ecosystem. It provides a framework for creating, managing, and enforcing IP rights through smart contracts.
- **Benefits**: This integration allows model creators to tokenize their ML models as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), enabling secure and transparent IP licensing, revenue sharing, and creating a novel marketplace for ML models.

### Chainlink

- **Functionality**: Chainlink's decentralized oracle network is used to securely and reliably bring real-world data into the Anacostia-Blockchain environment. It enables dynamic pricing of ML models based on various metrics accessible through the Anacostia API.
- **Benefits**: With Chainlink, Anacostia-Blockchain can automate model pricing and transactions based on performance metrics, market demand, and other criteria, ensuring fair valuation and enhancing market efficiency.

### Web3.Storage

- **Functionality**: Web3.Storage provides an additional layer for decentralized storage, similar to IPFS, but with a simplified interface for storing and retrieving data.
- **Benefits**: Integrating Web3.Storage offers developers and data scientists an easy-to-use option for storing ML datasets, models, and related metadata on decentralized networks, further securing data and enhancing redundancy.

### Web3.py

- **Functionality**: Web3.py is a Python library for interacting with Ethereum, enabling the Anacostia-Blockchain framework to connect with Ethereum-based smart contracts, decentralized applications (DApps), and services.
- **Benefits**: This allows Anacostia-Blockchain pipelines to integrate directly with the Ethereum blockchain for executing smart contracts, managing NFTs, and ensuring secure, transparent transactions within the MLOps workflows.

By integrating these core components, Anacostia-Blockchain delivers a comprehensive solution for decentralized MLOps, addressing challenges related to data security, IP management, dynamic pricing, and interoperability within the machine learning and blockchain domains.


### Core Node Types

- **Metadata Store Nodes**: Now capable of recording metadata on the blockchain for immutable history and enhanced trust.
- **Resource Nodes**: Support for decentralized storage, ensuring secure and globally accessible data sharing.
- **Action Nodes**: Extended to include blockchain interactions such as minting model NFTs and executing smart contracts for deployment.

### Distinguishing Features

- **Local and Cloud Compatibility**: Works seamlessly both locally and in cloud environments, benefiting from blockchain's security and transparency.
- **Incremental Pipeline Building**: Allows for stepwise pipeline construction, with blockchain integration enhancing each stage.
- **Interchangeable Nodes**: Provides a standardized API for nodes, facilitating easy substitution and blockchain service integration.

## Installation

Make sure you're running Python 3.11 or later. See `CONTRIBUTORS.md` for guidance on updating Python.

```bash
pip install anacostia-blockchain

Example Usage
Below is an example demonstrating how to set up a simple MLOps pipeline with Anacostia-Blockchain, including steps for model evaluation and leveraging blockchain for enhanced data integrity and model management.

# Import pipeline and node classes
from anacostia_blockchain.pipeline import Pipeline
from anacostia_blockchain.nodes import MonitoringDataStoreNode, ShakespeareEvalNode
from anacostia_blockchain.metadata import SqliteMetadataStore
# Additional blockchain-related variables and imports are initialized here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize metadata store and nodes
    metadata_store = SqliteMetadataStore("metadata_store", "sqlite:///metadata.db")
    data_store = MonitoringDataStoreNode("data_store", "/data/path", metadata_store)
    eval_node = ShakespeareEvalNode("eval_node", [data_store], metadata_store)
    
    # Define and execute the pipeline, integrating blockchain functionalities
    pipeline = Pipeline(nodes=[metadata_store, data_store, eval_node])
    pipeline.execute()
